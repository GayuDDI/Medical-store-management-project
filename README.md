1.1	Preface
The Medical Store Management System is designed to automate and streamline the operations of medical stores. Given the growing complexity of managing inventory, sales, and customer interactions, this project aims to simplify these processes through a user-friendly software application.
By leveraging Java technology, the system provides a robust platform that can handle various tasks efficiently, ensuring that medical stores can serve their customers effectively while maintaining accurate records.


1.2	Problem Statement
Medical stores often rely on manual processes for managing inventory and sales, which can lead to inefficiencies and errors. Common issues include stockouts, overstocking, inaccurate sales records, and difficulties in tracking customer information. These challenges not only affect operational efficiency but also impact customer satisfaction. This project addresses these problems by developing an integrated system that automates key functions, allowing for real-time inventory tracking and streamlined sales processes.
